An app to facilitate anonymous conversations between rival sports fanbases.

- Rooms open 20 minutes before the start of an athletic event, and close 20 minutes after.
- Chat is only available to participants within a geographic radius of the sports teamsâ€™ location
- Outsiders can view conversations between rival fanbases, but not participate.
- The feed will be similar to twitter in design, but participants are able reply directly to tweets.
